description: >
    As much as this course tries to make examples that are examples of practical usage, 
    I couldn't think of one off the top of my head. So: 

    You are given a list of numbers. Iterate through the numbers, squaring them, and then 
    creating a sum of the squared numbers.  

    For example. 

    5, 7, 2 => 25, 49, 4 => 78 

    Your input is in the template
